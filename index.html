            <p class="secondPara small-text">Lisa recently moved from a position in our Customer Success team to our
                Product team. Despite the
                steep learning curve associated with a shift in career direction, Lisa is already
                showing great potential in her new role. She displays an ability to learn rapidly and a determination to
                broaden her skill set.
                Lisa frequently takes the initiative to identify areas for improvement within the Product team and leads
                the way in addressing
                those issues. Late last year, she utilized her knowledge of customer needs to improve a key feature
                within our product. This
                required the development of basic programming skills, which she has shown great
                enthusiasm for learning. Lisa is currently enrolled in a three-month introductory programming course
                that she spends four hours
                per week working to enhance her skills.

            <p class="secondPara small-text">Jessica demonstrates a practical and data-driven approach to
                problem-solving.
                She actively seeks different perspectives and creative solutions from her teammates and is continuously
                experimenting to drive results.
                Following a dip in attendance at our annual conference, Jessica organized the collection of feedback
                from
                past attendees that revealed key themes for improvement. She also coordinated with our marketing team to
                refine the targeting of our Facebook ads and develop a strategic outreach plan that involved contacting
                influencers in our industry.
                These efforts resulted in a 25% increase in attendance over the previous year and an improvement in our
                event evaluation scores.This has led to delays in execution and failure to hit production goals. During
                the next quarter,

            <p class="firstPara big-text">Good Communication</p>
            <p class="secondPara small-text">Kate has displayed improved communication skills since our last review
                period. She responds to emails in a timely fashion and maintains transparency into the work she is
                performing with her team members. To help achieve this, she has committed to delivering a weekly
                progress report and arriving with prepared notes to her one-to-one sessions.

                Kate, however, still needs to focus on her level of accountability and willingness to take ownership
                when projects fall short of expectations. When faced with difficult situations, she has a tendency to
                become defensive and divert blame away from herself.
